# XSheet - Command-Line Spreadsheet
Ruby-based graphical command-line spreadsheet application.

This application was iteratively developed as part of an advanced programming languages course at my university. Over the course of development I developed various data abstractions ("primitive" and non-primitive), a lexer, a parser, a grammar system, and both an executor and serializer utilizing a visitor algorithm. Finally, this was all capped-off with a terminal user interface using Curses.
